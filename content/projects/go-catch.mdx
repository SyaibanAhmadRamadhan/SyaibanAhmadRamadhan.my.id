title: Go Catch
description: GOCATCH is a collection library created by me. Go based project designed to perform various migration operations and databases. This project uses various Go libraries, such as goose for managing migration databases, pgx as PostgreSQL driver and toolkit, as well as godotenv to load environment variables. The project structure is divided into several directories, each with its own function. For example, the gcommon directory contains common utility functions, gcrypto for cryptographic functions, gdb for database related functions, gdir for path and module handling, and genv for managing variables .env, glog for canonical logging paths, and others. GOCATCH is a comprehensive and powerful Go project designed to improve the efficiency and performance of your software development. But now I no longer maintain this library.
